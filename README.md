# Morgan Body Next

This is the development branch of the next release (v3).
Three main goals of v3:

- Rewrite in **TypeScript**
- Compatibility across **more** libraries, not just Express
- Easier way to log on multiple places via **transports**

# TODO

- ~~Implement transports~~
- Complete codebase transfer to TypeScript
- Write new tests (possibly replace mocha with jest?)
- Cleanup some old code
- ~~Get rid of [expressjs/morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)~~
- Create new name, as `morgan-body` will become misleading
